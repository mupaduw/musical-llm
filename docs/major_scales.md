A major scale is one of the most fundamental musical scales in Western music. It consists of seven distinct notes (or pitches) before reaching the eighth note, which is the same as the first but an octave higher. The structure of a major scale follows a specific pattern of whole steps and half steps between these notes.

The sequence of intervals in a major scale can be broken down into whole steps (W) and half steps (H):

1. **Whole Step**: A step from one note to another with one note in between.
2. **Half Step**: A direct move from one note to the next adjacent note on the piano keyboard.

The pattern for a major scale is: **W - W - H - W - W - W - H**.

To illustrate, let's construct a C major scale using this pattern:

- Start with the note C.
- Move up a whole step to D.
- Move up another whole step to E.
- Then move up a half step to F.
- Follow with a whole step to G.
- Another whole step to A.
- One more whole step to B.
- Finally, move up a half step back to the next C (an octave higher).

So, the notes in a C major scale are: **C - D - E - F - G - A - B - C**.

This pattern of intervals can be applied starting on any note to create different major scales. For instance, if you start on D, following the same pattern, you would get the D major scale: **D - E - F# - G - A - B - C# - D** (note that sharps are used to maintain the whole and half step pattern).

The specific key signature of a major scale determines which notes are sharp or flat. For example:
- The key of G major has one sharp (F#).
- The key of F major has one flat (Bb).

Understanding this structure is crucial for composing, improvising, and analyzing music in the Western tradition.
