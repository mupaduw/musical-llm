Middle Eastern music is rich with unique scales that contribute to its distinctive sound, often characterized by microtonal intervals and exotic tonal colors not typically found in Western classical or popular music. Here are some of the most prominent scales used in Middle Eastern music:

### 1. **Maqam System**

The maqam system forms the basis of traditional Arabic music and includes a variety of modes, each with its own specific scale, emotional character, and set of rules for progression.

#### Common Maqamat

- **Maqam Rast**: Often compared to the major scale but with microtonal variations. It typically starts on D in instrumental music and C in vocal music.
  
- **Maqam Bayati**: One of the most popular maqams, featuring a minor feel with a raised third (leading tone). Commonly starting on A.

- **Maqam Hijaz**: Known for its exotic sound, characterized by an augmented second interval. Typically starts on B.

- **Maqam Nahawand**: Has a similar structure to the Western Phrygian mode but includes microtonal variations. Often starts on E.

- **Maqam Kurd**: Features an augmented second and has similarities to both Bayati and Hijaz, often starting on C or G.

### 2. **Dastgah System**

The Persian dastgah system is somewhat analogous to the maqam system but includes a set of seven principal dastgahs (modes), each with its own repertoire of melodies and improvisational rules.

#### Common Dastgah

- **Dastgah Shur**: Known for its expressive potential, often starting on C or A. It has a minor feel with microtonal inflections.

- **Dastgah Homayun**: Has a major scale feel but includes microtones and specific intervals that give it an Eastern character, typically starting on D.

- **Dastgah Segah**: Features an upbeat, joyful sound with a raised fourth (sharp 4th), often starting on E or C.

### Characteristics of Middle Eastern Scales

1. **Microtonality**: Many Middle Eastern scales incorporate microtonesâ€”intervals smaller than the semitones used in Western music. These are often achieved through specific fingerings or vocal techniques.

2. **Quarter Tones**: The division of the octave into 24 equal parts (quarter tones) is common, allowing for nuanced expressions between traditional Western pitches.

3. **Augmented Seconds**: Several scales include augmented second intervals, giving them a distinctive sound that is both exotic and expressive.

4. **Emotional Expression**: Each maqam or dastgah carries specific emotional connotations and cultural associations, often used to convey particular moods or narratives in music.

5. **Improvisation**: These scales are foundational for improvisation, allowing musicians to explore the rich tonal possibilities within a structured framework.

### Usage

These scales are central to traditional Middle Eastern music across various instruments like the oud (lute), ney (reed flute), qanun (zither), and vocal performances. They also influence contemporary compositions and fusion genres that blend Western and Eastern musical elements.

Understanding these scales provides valuable insight into the rich tapestry of Middle Eastern music, offering a glimpse into its cultural heritage and artistic depth.
