Modal scales are sequences of notes derived from diatonic modes, which are essentially variations of the major scale with different starting points (or "tonic" notes). Unlike the typical major and minor scales that focus on a sequence of whole and half steps to create tension and resolution, modal scales offer unique tonal flavors by altering specific intervals within the scale. There are seven traditional diatonic modes, each providing distinct characteristics:

### 1. **Ionian Mode**

- **Description**: The Ionian mode is essentially the same as the major scale.
  
- **Pattern**: Whole Step (W), Whole Step (W), Half Step (H), Whole Step (W), Whole Step (W), Whole Step (W), Half Step (H).

- **Example in C**: C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C

- **Characteristics**: Bright and happy sound.

### 2. **Dorian Mode**

- **Description**: Starts on the second degree of the major scale.
  
- **Pattern**: Whole Step (W), Half Step (H), Whole Step (W), Whole Step (W), Whole Step (W), Half Step (H), Whole Step (W).

- **Example in D**: D, E, F, G, A, B, C, D

- **Characteristics**: Slightly more somber than the major scale but with a distinctive minor quality; often used in jazz and folk music.

### 3. **Phrygian Mode**

- **Description**: Begins on the third degree of the major scale.
  
- **Pattern**: Half Step (H), Whole Step (W), Whole Step (W), Whole Step (W), Half Step (H), Whole Step (W), Whole Step (W).

- **Example in E**: E, F, G, A, B, C, D, E

- **Characteristics**: Has an exotic or Spanish sound due to the half step between the tonic and second degree.

### 4. **Lydian Mode**

- **Description**: Begins on the fourth degree of the major scale.
  
- **Pattern**: Whole Step (W), Whole Step (W), Whole Step (W), Half Step (H), Whole Step (W), Whole Step (W), Half Step (H).

- **Example in F**: F, G, A, B, C, D, E, F

- **Characteristics**: Bright and somewhat ethereal due to the raised fourth degree.

### 5. **Mixolydian Mode**

- **Description**: Starts on the fifth degree of the major scale.
  
- **Pattern**: Whole Step (W), Whole Step (W), Half Step (H), Whole Step (W), Whole Step (W), Half Step (H), Whole Step (W).

- **Example in G**: G, A, B, C, D, E, F, G

- **Characteristics**: Has a rock or bluesy feel due to the lowered seventh degree; popular in rock and folk music.

### 6. **Aeolian Mode**

- **Description**: The Aeolian mode is equivalent to the natural minor scale.
  
- **Pattern**: Whole Step (W), Half Step (H), Whole Step (W), Whole Step (W), Half Step (H), Whole Step (W), Whole Step (W).

- **Example in A**: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, A

- **Characteristics**: Sad or melancholic sound.

### 7. **Locrian Mode**

- **Description**: Begins on the seventh degree of the major scale.
  
- **Pattern**: Half Step (H), Whole Step (W), Whole Step (W), Half Step (H), Whole Step (W), Whole Step (W), Whole Step (W).

- **Example in B**: B, C, D, E, F, G, A, B

- **Characteristics**: Rarely used due to its unstable sound from the diminished fifth degree.

### Usage

Modal scales are widely utilized across various music genres for their unique tonal colors. They offer composers and musicians a broad palette of expressive possibilities beyond traditional major and minor harmonic frameworks, making them essential in jazz, classical, folk, rock, and film scores. Understanding modal scales allows for more creative exploration in composition and improvisation, providing distinct moods and atmospheres that differ from conventional scale choices.
