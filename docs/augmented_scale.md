The augmented scale is another symmetrical musical scale, characterized by its interval structure of alternating minor thirds (m3). This creates a unique eight-note scale that divides the octave into three equal parts.

### Characteristics

1. **Symmetry**: The augmented scale consists entirely of minor third intervals, making it highly symmetrical and non-functional in terms of traditional harmony. This symmetry allows for any note within the scale to serve as a starting point without changing its intervallic structure.

2. **Enharmonic Equivalence**: Like the diminished scale, the augmented scale has two enharmonically equivalent forms that sound identical but start on different notes:
   - m3-m3-m3-m3 (Minor Third Augmented Scale)
   - M3-M3-M3-M3 (Major Third Augmented Scale)

3. **Augmented Triads**: Each note in the augmented scale is a root of an augmented triad, contributing to its distinctive sound.

4. **Three-note Repetition**: The scale can be seen as three identical notes repeated twice in succession, due to the equal division of the octave into thirds.

### Example

Starting on C, the augmented scale would look like this:

- **C Augmented Scale (Minor Third starting form)**: C, E♭, G♭, B♭, C, E♭, G♭, B♭.

The same scale can be viewed as a major third pattern starting from E♭:

- **E♭ Major Third starting form**: E♭, G, B, D, E♭, G, B, D.

### Usage

The augmented scale is less commonly used than the diminished or whole-tone scales but offers unique harmonic possibilities that are particularly appealing in certain musical contexts:

1. **Jazz and Contemporary Music**: In jazz, the augmented scale can be used over augmented triads (augmented chords) to add color and tension. It's also useful for creating smooth voice leading due to its symmetrical nature.

2. **Impressionism and Modern Classical Music**: Composers like Claude Debussy have employed the augmented scale to evoke an ethereal, dreamlike quality in their music. Its non-functional harmony makes it suitable for exploring atonal or modal soundscapes.

3. **Modulation and Transition**: The symmetry of the augmented scale allows for seamless modulation between keys, making it a valuable tool for composers looking to create fluid transitions without traditional harmonic anchor points.

4. **Melodic Exploration**: Musicians can use the augmented scale to craft melodies that stand apart from diatonic conventions, offering a distinct sound that can add intrigue and interest to compositions or improvisations.

### Limitations

The augmented scale's symmetrical structure and lack of functional harmony mean it doesn't naturally lead to tonal resolution. This can make it challenging to incorporate into music that relies on traditional harmonic progressions. However, its unique sound continues to inspire composers and musicians seeking new ways to express themselves beyond conventional tonal boundaries.

In summary, the augmented scale offers a distinctive palette for creating tension, color, and fluidity in music, making it an intriguing option for those looking to explore beyond the confines of traditional harmony.
