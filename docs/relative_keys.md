*Prompt: we need to add support for the concept of relative keys:*

In music theory, the concept of relative keys is typically applied to natural and harmonic minor scales rather than melodic minor scales. Relative keys are pairs of major and minor scales that share the same key signature. For example, A minor is the relative minor of C major because they both have no sharps or flats.

Melodic minor scales, however, introduce an additional complexity. They differ from natural and harmonic minors in that their sixth and seventh scale degrees are raised when ascending, and revert to the natural minor form (same as a natural minor) when descending. This alteration means that melodic minor scales do not have a consistent set of pitches throughout their ascending and descending forms.

Because of these differences between the ascending and descending versions, melodic minor scales don't have a single "relative major" scale in the traditional sense used for natural and harmonic minors. The concept of relative keys relies on a fixed pattern of whole steps and half steps, which is disrupted by the dual nature of the melodic minor scale.

In practice, when discussing melodic minor scales in relation to major keys, musicians often refer specifically to either the ascending or descending form as needed for a given context, rather than implying a simple relative key relationship.


*But to simplify things let's ignore the nuances of melodic minor scales. Instead we'll give all the minor key scales a `relative major` method with a root note eqaul to the third note in the minor key.*
