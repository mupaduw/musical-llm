Great now please add support for the minor scales natural, harmonic and melodic minor. Here's some more info:

*Note Phi4 made a mistake:  the example ascending melodic minor is wrong.. But fixed in code/tests*

Minor scales are fundamental in Western music, offering a more somber or melancholic sound compared to major scales. There are three primary types of minor scales: natural minor, harmonic minor, and melodic minor. Each has distinct characteristics due to variations in the pattern of whole steps (W) and half steps (H).

### 1. Natural Minor Scale

The natural minor scale follows a specific pattern of intervals:

- **Whole Step** (W)

- **Half Step** (H)

- **Whole Step** (W)

- **Whole Step** (W)

- **Half Step** (H)

- **Whole Step** (W)

- **Whole Step** (W)

This scale can also be derived by starting on the sixth degree of a major scale. For example, A natural minor is the relative minor of C major:

1. Start on A.

2. Whole step to B.

3. Half step to C.

4. Whole step to D.

5. Whole step to E.

6. Half step to F.

7. Whole step to G.

8. Whole step back to A.

### 2. Harmonic Minor Scale

The harmonic minor scale alters the natural minor scale by raising the seventh note by a half step, creating an augmented second interval between the sixth and seventh notes:

- **Whole Step** (W)

- **Half Step** (H)

- **Whole Step** (W)

- **Whole Step** (W)

- **Half Step** (H)

- **Augmented Second** (A2) - equivalent to a W + H

- **Half Step** (H)

This adjustment gives the scale a distinctive sound often used in classical and modern music for its tension and resolution.

For example, A harmonic minor:

1. Start on A.

2. Whole step to B.

3. Half step to C.

4. Whole step to D.

5. Whole step to E.

6. Half step to F.

7. Augmented second to G# (G sharp).

8. Half step back to A.

### 3. Melodic Minor Scale

The melodic minor scale has a unique feature: it raises both the sixth and seventh notes by a half step when ascending, while descending it follows the natural minor pattern:

Ascending:

- **Whole Step** (W)

- **Half Step** (H)

- **Whole Step** (W)

- **Whole Step** (W)

- **Whole Step** (W)

- **Half Step** (H)

- **Half Step** (H)

Descending (reverts to natural minor):

- **Whole Step** (W)

- **Half Step** (H)

- **Whole Step** (W)

- **Whole Step** (W)

- **Half Step** (H)

- **Whole Step** (W)

- **Whole Step** (W)

This dual behavior allows for smooth melodic lines in both directions, often used in melodies and solos.

For example, A melodic minor:

Ascending:

1. Start on A.

2. Whole step to B.

3. Half step to C.

4. Whole step to D.

5. Whole step to E.

6. Whole step to F# (F sharp).

7. Half step to G# (G sharp).

8. Half step back to A.

Descending:

1. Start on A.

2. Whole step to G.

3. Half step to F.

4. Whole step to E.

5. Whole step to D.

6. Whole step to C.

7. Half step to B.

8. Whole step back to A.

These variations in minor scales provide composers and musicians with a rich palette of emotional expression, each offering unique harmonic possibilities.
